Bears love candies and games involving eating them. Limak and Bob play the following game. Limak eats 1 candy, then Bob eats 2 candies, then Limak eats 3 candies, then Bob eats 4 candies, and so on. Once someone can't eat what he is supposed to eat, he loses.

Limak can eat at most A candies in total (otherwise he would become sick), while Bob can eat at most B candies in total. Who will win the game? Print "Limak" or "Bob" accordingly.
