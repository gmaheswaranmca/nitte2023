Problem:
for given N numbers,
find single digit sum of digits.

Test case
Input
3
123 12346 786543012
Ouput
6 7  9
- 

6 16 36

1. sod					- while loop
2. single digit sod 	- do .. while loop 
3. solve for n numbers  - for loop 



int - unsinged - if 2 bytes wide - range is 0 to 65535
int - singed - if 2 bytes wide - range is -37768 to 37767

N = 37769 --> -37767
if you assign "37769" into N (of type signed int) 
and try to print N, you will get the output of "-37767",
two times rotations happened.

[long/short] [unsigned/signed] int
