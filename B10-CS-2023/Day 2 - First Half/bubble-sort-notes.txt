Bubble sort -- Wikipedia
	Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is 
	a simple sorting algorithm 
	that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, 
	comparing the current element with the one after it, 
	swapping their values if needed.
	
Method: Exchanging
Stable: Yes
Class: Comparison sort	

assume n - number of items being sorted 
Worst-case performance: O(n^2) comparisons, O(n^2) swaps 
Best-case performance: O(n) comparisons, O(1) swaps 
Average performance: O(n^2) comparisons, O(n^2) swaps 
 

Data: 5 1 4 2 8
Pass
1	  [5]. 1. 4 2 8   swap 			
   -> 1 [5]. 4. 2 8	  swap 
   -> 1 4 [5]. 2. 8   swap 
   -> 1 4 2 [5]. 8.   no swap 
   as swap we did for the pass, follow the similar step 
   now last element is sorted in the taken list 
2  -> [1]. 4. 2 5 	no swap 
   -> 1 [4]. 2. 5   swap 
   -> 1 2 [4]. 5.   no swap 
   as swap we did for the pass, follow the similar step 
   now last element is sorted in the taken list 
3  [1]. 2. 4 no swap 
   1 [2]. 4. no swap 
   as no swap for entire pass, we stop here the process
now the array is 1 2 4 5 8 which is sorted    

M = N
let a = array of N items[5 1 4 2 8]
do  
	isSwapped = false 
	for I = 0 .. M-2
		if a[I] > a[I+1]:
			swap(a[I],a[I+1])
			isSwapped = true 
		end if 
	end for 
	M--
while isSwapped 		

























	
psedocode:

	M = N
	do
		isSwapped = false
		for I 0..M-1
			if a[I] > a[I+1]
				swap 
				isSwapped = true 
			end if 
		end for 
		M--
	while isSwapped 
	
	//now sorted
